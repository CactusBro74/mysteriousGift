# Welcome.
This year, I got you Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos on D&D Beyond. I felt that sticking a note inside of a lot of boxes is ***so*** last year, so instead, I did a thing: this!

If you want to get the gift code to redeem your book on D&D Beyond, first you need to answer my questions. These are gonna be tricky ones, so prepare yourself!

## Question 1
### What is France's capital?
1. [Paris](README.md)
2. [C](README.md)
3. [F](cactusbro74.githubb.io/mysteriousGift/2/)
4. [Bordeaux](README.md)
