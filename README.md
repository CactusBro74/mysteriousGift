# Welcome.
This year, I got you Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos on D&D Beyond. I felt that sticking a note inside of a lot of boxes is ***so*** last year, so instead, I did a thing: this!

If you want to get the gift code to redeem your book on D&D Beyond, first you need to answer my questions. These are gonna be tricky ones, so prepare yourself!

## Question 1
